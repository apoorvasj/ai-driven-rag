Concepts \\nand techniques such as Total Quality Management  \\nor TQM1, Kaizen, Kanban, HOSHIN or Hoshin kanri , \\nand Just in Time have been recognised and implement-\\ned in organisations in many different cultures and geog-\\nraphies since the 1970s. \\nJapanese management methodologies are standardised, \\nprocedure-driven and based on ‘regimes’. As such, they \\nare usually quite difficult to transplant directly in their \\nindigenous form to European or American business or-\\nganisations which tend to have a radically different \\ncorporate culture. These me thodologies offer a unique \\napproach to people motivation and there is a great em-\\nphasis on professional development, demonstrating in-\\ndividual innovation and creative thinking. Well \\ndeveloped and loyal human resources are considered \\nto be among the most valuable assets. Customer \\nand supplier relations are based on close relationships \\nand collaboration. This offers a competitive advantage \\ndriven by high quality products, strong productivity, \\nshort lead times and low costs. Organisations which are \\n                                                           \\n1 Quality Management as a met hod of organisational improve-\\nment was developed in the U.S. by E. Deming. Since his ideas \\nwere not embraced by American businesses at the time he pro-\\nmoted them in Japan. He is believed to be amongst the architects \\nof the Japanese economic miracle as TQM found its way \\nto many different sectors in the 1960s. \\nnot powerful market players with access to vast capital \\nresources may still become very successful by putting \\nin place many of these principles. Being observant \\nand making adjustments to everyday operations will \\nusually be enough. Knowledge management will be \\nmuch easier in organisations which operate to these \\nprinciples and have established such practices. \\nKnowledge management is not just about strategy, \\nhowever. It is based on well identified and analysed \\navailable and critical reso urces. Knowledge is one \\nof such critical resources in an organisation. Incremen-\\ntal steps must be taken to implement measures \\nand processes to achieve the goals and objectives of the \\norganisation. Knowledge management leads to the de-\\nconstruction of stereotypes in order to accomplish \\nmeasurable success\\n2. A new management philosophy is \\nrequired, which offers a new mind set and a new way \\nof interpreting social, economic and corporate devel-\\nopments. A paradigm shift in management is essential \\nto break away from traditional and, indeed, obsolete \\nways. Knowledge management offers itself as the new \\nparadigm in business.  \\nIn knowledge management, it is the human resources \\nthat have attracted companies’ and event countries’ at-\\ntention as a possible source of competitive advantage. \\nIn fact, countries can develop their own research \\nand development potential and take advantage of the \\n                                                           \\n2 T.

      "content=\"Activation functions play a crucial role in deep learning, as they introduce non-linearity into the neural network, enabling it to learn and represent complex relationships between inputs and outputs. The importance of activation functions can be summarized as follows:\\n\\n1. **Introducing Non-Linearity**: Activation functions help to break the linearity of the neural network, allowing it to learn and represent non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. Without non-linearity, the neural network would only be able to learn linear relationships, which is not sufficient for many real-world problems.\\n2. **Enabling Feature Learning**: Activation functions enable the neural network to learn features from the input data, such as edges, textures, and patterns. This is particularly important in image and speech recognition tasks, where the neural network needs to learn features that are not easily extracted using linear transformations.\\n3. **Improving Model Capacity**: Activation functions increase the capacity of the neural network, allowing it to learn more complex relationships between inputs and outputs. This is because non-linear activation functions can produce a larger range of output values, enabling the neural network to learn more nuanced representations of the input data.\\n4. **Preventing Vanishing Gradients**: Some activation functions, such as ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) and its variants, help to prevent vanishing gradients during backpropagation. Vanishing gradients occur when the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters become very small, making it difficult to update the model's parameters during training.\\n5. **Regularization**: Some activation functions, such as dropout and its variants, can be used as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting. By randomly dropping out neurons during training, dropout helps to prevent the neural network from relying too heavily on any individual neuron or group of neurons.\\n6. **Improving Robustness**: Activation functions can help to improve the robustness of the neural network to noise and adversarial attacks. For example, some activation functions, such as the sigmoid function, can help to reduce the impact of noise on the neural network's output.\\n7. **Enabling Sparse Representations**: Some activation functions, such as ReLU and its variants, can help to produce sparse representations of the input data. Sparse representations can be useful for reducing the dimensionality of the input data and improving the efficiency of the neural network.\\n\\nSome common activation functions used in deep learning include:\\n\\n* Sigmoid: maps the input to a value between 0 and 1\\n* ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit): maps the input to 0 if it is negative, and to the input value if it is positive\\n* Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent): maps the input to a value between -1 and 1\\n* Softmax: maps the input to a probability distribution over multiple classes\\n* Leaky ReLU: a variant of ReLU that allows a small fraction of the input to pass through, even if it is negative\\n* Swish: a recently introduced activation function that has been shown to outperform ReLU in some tasks.\\n\\nIn summary, activation functions are a crucial component of deep learning models, enabling them to learn complex relationships between inputs and outputs, and improving their capacity, robustness, and efficiency.\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 653, 'prompt_tokens': 46, 'total_tokens': 699, 'completion_time': 1.429904444, 'prompt_time': 0.002632688, 'queue_time': 0.053154352, 'total_time': 1.432537132}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_9e1e8f8435', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run--f8b78a85-93d4-42f1-ac9c-32749b390a7a-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 46, 'output_tokens': 653, 'total_tokens': 699}\n"

       " 'answer': \"According to I. Nonaka and H. Takeuchi, the essentials of the knowledge management model can be summarized as follows:\\n\\n1. **Knowledge is a critical resource**: Knowledge is one of the critical resources in an organization, and its management is essential for success.\\n2. **Knowledge creation is key**: The creation of new knowledge is a crucial aspect of knowledge management, and organizations must examine the mechanisms and processes of knowledge creation.\\n3. **Well-identified and analyzed resources**: Knowledge management is based on well-identified and analyzed available and critical resources, including knowledge.\\n4. **More than just strategy**: Knowledge management is not just about strategy, but also about understanding the underlying principles and practices that support knowledge creation and sharing.\\n5. **Focus on knowledge creation mechanisms**: The model emphasizes the importance of understanding the mechanisms and processes of knowledge creation, which is essential for organizations to innovate and stay competitive.\\n\\nAdditionally, Nonaka and Takeuchi's knowledge management model is often summarized into four modes of knowledge conversion:\\n\\n1. **Socialization**: Sharing tacit knowledge through social interactions.\\n2. **Externalization**: Converting tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge through documentation and communication.\\n3. **Combination**: Combining different pieces of explicit knowledge to create new knowledge.\\n4. **Internalization**: Converting explicit knowledge into tacit knowledge through experience and practice.\\n\\nThese essentials and modes of knowledge conversion form the foundation of the knowledge management model by Nonaka and Takeuchi.\"}"
